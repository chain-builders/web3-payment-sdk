## Example: Customizing the Widget

You can customize the widget's appearance and behavior:

\`\`\`tsx
<PaytronWidget
  apiKey="your-api-key"
  currency="USDC"
  amount={500} // 5 USDC
  theme={{
    primaryColor: "#4A90E2",
    secondaryColor: "#FFFFFF",
    fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif",
  }}
  onSuccess={(transaction) => alert("Payment Successful!")}
  onError={(error) => alert("Payment Failed!")}
  metadata={{
    orderId: "12345",
    customerEmail: "customer@example.com",
  }}
/>
\`\`\`

## Handling Transactions

When a payment is successful, the \`onSuccess\` callback provides a transaction object:

\`\`\`json
{
  "transactionId": "abc123",
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "USDT",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-09T12:00:00Z"
}
\`\`\`

You can use this data to update your backend or display a confirmation to the user.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the payment process, the \`onError\` callback provides an error object:

\`\`\`json
{
  "code": "PAYMENT_FAILED",
  "message": "Insufficient funds",
  "details": {}
}
\`\`\`
